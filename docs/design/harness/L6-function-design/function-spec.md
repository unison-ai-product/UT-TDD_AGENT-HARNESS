## 2026-06-09 FR Unit Coverage Addendum

- Before L6 can be closed, the L1 FR registry must be parsed by `fr-registry-audit` and every registered FR must be represented in `fr-unit-coverage.md`.
- `fr-unit-coverage.md` maps each FR-L1 row to one L6 spec path, one deterministic unit contract, and one U-* oracle.
- `src/lint/l6-fr-coverage.ts` is the mechanical guard for this rule and is wired into `ut-tdd doctor`.
- Contracts listed in `fr-unit-coverage.md` are unit-test-granularity specifications. L7 may implement them as direct unit tests or route them through a confirmed follow-up PLAN, but it may not invent missing FR coverage at implementation time.

## 2026-06-09 Harness DB Feedback Function Addendum

This addendum lowers requirements §6.8.6/§6.8.7 and L5 `physical-data.md` §9 / `internal-processing.md` Appendix B to L6 function-level contracts. The SQLite DB is a rebuildable projection of docs/state/logs, not the authoring source.

| Function | Signature | pre | post / oracle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recordProjectionEvent` | `(event: ProjectionEvent, deps: HarnessDbDeps) => ProjectionRowRef` | `event.plan_id` or `event.session_id` is present; `deps.dbPath` resolves under `.ut-tdd/` | validates IDs, upserts the correct projection table row, returns `{table, id, evidence_path}`; never rewrites source docs |
| `rebuildHarnessDb` | `(input: RebuildInput, deps: HarnessDbDeps) => RebuildResult` | repo root is readable; DB path is under `.ut-tdd/` | truncates projection tables, replays normalized docs/state/log digests, recomputes `search_index` and `quality_signals`; deterministic for identical inputs |
| `computeSkillMetrics` | `(rows: SkillMetricInput) => QualitySignal[]` | recommendation/invocation rows are supplied; zero denominator is explicit | computes `fired/recommended` and `accepted/fired` by layer/drive/plan/model; missing rows become findings, not fabricated success |
| `findReference` | `(query: ReferenceQuery, deps: HarnessDbDeps) => ReferenceHit[]` | DB exists or caller requested rebuild first | searches `search_index` plus direct ID tables and returns path, ID, reason, source table, and evidence path; read-only |
| `emitFeedbackEvents` | `(findings: FindingRow[], signals: QualitySignal[]) => FeedbackEvent[]` | findings/signals are normalized | groups repeated gaps, unresolved blockers, dependency stalls, and quality regression patterns into feedback events; does not auto-approve PLAN changes |
| `recordGuardrailDecision` | `(decision: GuardrailDecision, deps: HarnessDbDeps) => ProjectionRowRef` | guardrail name, decision, and evidence path are present | stores block/allow/human-required with evidence; `human-required` cannot be downgraded by projection rebuild |
| `catalogAutomationAssets` | `(input: CatalogAutomationAssetsInput) => AssetCatalogResult`（`input = { repoRoot?: string; db: HarnessDb }`、型は `src/assets/catalog.ts` 正本、PLAN-L7-52 C-4 で実装に整合化 2026-06-15） | 承認 root は実装内定数 `SOURCES`（`docs/skills` / `.claude/agents` / `docs/commands`）を単一正本とする（caller は roots を渡さない） | skill/roster/command doc を path・trigger/capability・search token・drift status で catalog 化し `{ ok, assets: string[], findings }` を返す; prompt 本文・secret・provider transcript は copy しない; drift / empty-catalog / invalid-root は `findings` として可視化 |
| `recordTestRunEvidence` | `(input: TestRunEvidenceInput, deps: HarnessDbDeps) => ProjectionRowRef[]` | command evidence has runner/scope/timestamps/exit code/evidence path; repo root and DB path resolve under `.ut-tdd/` | upserts `test_runs`, optional `test_cases`, `test_results`, and `test_artifact_edges`; missing `plan_id`/`oracle_id` creates findings, not silent pass |
| `evaluateGreenDefinition` | `(input: GreenDefinitionInput, deps: HarnessDbDeps) => GreenDefinitionResult` | profile and required command kinds are known for changed artifact kinds | returns computed green time, missing commands, non-zero exits, and DB projection refs; confirmed review evidence is valid only when result is green and `computed_green_at <= reviewed_at` |
| `computeUtHistorySignals` | `(input: UtHistoryInput, deps: HarnessDbDeps) => QualitySignal[]` | test run/result rows are normalized; zero denominators are explicit | computes oracle coverage, plan green rate, flake score, duration regression, and green-definition compliance; non-green signals join `findings` |

Unit oracle families:

- U-FR-L1-06 / U-FR-L1-19 / U-FR-L1-20 / U-FR-L1-40 / U-FR-L1-41 cover projection write/rebuild, drive partitioning, and feedback event generation.
- U-FR-L1-12 / U-FR-L1-46 / U-FR-L1-47 cover skill recommendation, roster capability, and skill metric inputs.
- U-FR-L1-33 / U-FR-L1-34 / U-FR-L1-48 / U-FR-L1-49 cover search/reference reduction, command cataloging, and asset drift detection.

## 2026-06-09 MCP Profile Config / Safety Addendum (A-125 / PLAN-L6-32)

This addendum lowers requirements §6.8.10 and the A-125 research memo into L6 function contracts for MCP profile catalog hardening. It does not authorize profile execution by itself; it defines the pure checks and generated-config rules that a later L7 implementation must satisfy.

| Function | Signature | pre | post | invariant | oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `catalogVerificationProfiles` | catalogVerificationProfiles(input: VerificationProfileCatalogInput) => VerificationProfileCatalogResult | built-in profiles and researched external candidates are supplied with source URL, package reference, trigger signals, and risk fields. | returns deterministic profile rows including Docker MCP Toolkit, MCP Inspector, Playwright MCP, GitHub read-only MCP, Vitest browser, Testcontainers, and MSW. | external profiles are disabled by default and are discovery/config metadata, not trusted execution. | U-MCPPROFILE-001..003 |
| `renderGeneratedMcpConfig` | renderGeneratedMcpConfig(input: GeneratedMcpConfigInput) => GeneratedMcpConfigResult | selected profiles are allow-listed, workspace root is known, and secret values are represented only by env var names. | returns generated local config text and target path suggestion without writing Git-tracked secrets. | filesystem/git profiles are workspace-root scoped; user home mounts and inline tokens are violations. | U-MCPPROFILE-004..006 |
| `analyzeVerificationProfileSafety` | analyzeVerificationProfileSafety(input: VerificationProfileSafetyInput) => VerificationProfileSafetyResult | profile catalog, local package metadata, config text, and optional Docker profile metadata are supplied. | returns findings for unverified source, package mismatch, missing allow-list, broad toolset, write-enabled GitHub profile, global mount, credential persistence, or missing Docker controls. | official source verification and package integrity are required before `trusted`; registry/catalog presence alone is insufficient. | U-MCPPROFILE-007..010 |
| `planExternalProfileActivation` | planExternalProfileActivation(input: ExternalProfileActivationInput) => ExternalProfileActivationPlan | trigger signals, relation graph impact, profile readiness, and safety findings are supplied. | returns required probe, MCP Inspector smoke, human approval, or refusal steps for each recommended profile. | external activation is workflow evidence; it cannot silently install packages or enable MCP servers. | U-MCPPROFILE-011..012 |

Safety defaults:

- Docker MCP Toolkit is a profile-isolation candidate and must remain optional unless Docker Desktop/toolkit availability is proven.
- GitHub MCP defaults to read-only and narrow toolsets; write-capable profile variants require `requires_human_approval`.
- Generated MCP config is local/environment state and must not introduce committed credentials or user-specific absolute home paths.
- Tool/profile output is normalized into evidence/projection rows; raw MCP responses, screenshots, traces, and provider transcripts are excluded from DB rows.

## 2026-06-09 Canonical Document Export Addendum (A-126 / PLAN-L6-34)

This addendum lowers requirements §6.8.11 and the A-126 research memo into L6 function contracts for converting canonical UT-TDD documents into spreadsheet / Excel / PPTX outputs. It does not authorize Office-format generation by itself; it defines the pure document-structure and export-dataset rules that a later L7 implementation must satisfy.

| Function | Signature | pre | post | invariant | oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `parseCanonicalDocumentStructure` | parseCanonicalDocumentStructure(input: CanonicalDocumentInput) => CanonicalDocumentProjection | source docs are supplied as repo-relative paths and text; document family is one of concept, requirements, design, plan, adr, or test-design. | returns sections, headings, tables, decisions, trace IDs, status fields, evidence links, and source anchors. | canonical Markdown/docs remain source of truth; generated exports cannot introduce or drop FR/AC/AT/PLAN/ADR IDs. | U-DOCEXPORT-001..003 |
| `buildDocumentExportDataset` | buildDocumentExportDataset(input: DocumentExportDatasetInput) => DocumentExportDataset | document projection, requested format, and export profile are supplied. | returns deterministic rows/sheets/slide-outline records with source path, section ID, ID columns, status, trace, and evidence links. | dataset is redacted before rendering; large docs split by family/section instead of truncating. | U-DOCEXPORT-004..006 |
| `renderDocumentExport` | renderDocumentExport(input: DocumentExportRenderInput, deps: DocumentExportRendererDeps) => DocumentExportRenderResult | dataset and renderer profile are supplied; CSV/Markdown are built-in; XLSX/PPTX/D2 require readiness. | returns generated artifact metadata or a renderer-unavailable finding. | renderer execution is optional and never installs packages implicitly. | U-DOCEXPORT-007..009 |
| `recordDocumentExportArtifact` | recordDocumentExportArtifact(input: DocumentExportArtifactInput) => DocumentExportProjectionRows | render result, source snapshot hash, redaction profile, and evidence path are supplied. | returns `document_export_runs`, `document_export_datasets`, and `document_export_artifacts` projection rows. | generated files are derived artifacts; gate truth remains canonical docs, normalized rows, and recorded human decisions. | U-DOCEXPORT-010..012 |

Supported document families:

- concept / planning documents -> objective, value, scope, KPI, risks, decisions, roadmap;
- requirements -> FR/AC/AT, priority, acceptance, trace, owner/status;
- detailed design -> module/function/API/DB/contract rows, dependencies, unresolved carry;
- PLAN -> frontmatter, dependencies, generated artifacts, DoD, evidence, blockers;
- ADR -> decision, alternatives, consequences, follow-ups, status/date;
- test-design -> U/IT/AT oracles, GWT rows, green definitions, missing coverage.

Export defaults:

- CSV and Markdown summary are built-in.
- XLSX is optional via ExcelJS or SheetJS readiness.
- PPTX is optional via PptxGenJS readiness.
- D2 PPTX is optional for architecture/workflow diagrams only.

### FR registry function contract table

This table is the function-spec-side descent for rows in `fr-unit-coverage.md` whose L6 spec is this file. It prevents the FR matrix from becoming a prose-only coverage claim. Each row is intentionally unit-test sized: one or more named functions, a concrete signature shape, DbC pre/post/invariant, and the exact U-FR oracle.

### FR registry type body / pseudocode substance

This section closes A-110 MUST-2. Rows above are L6 unit contracts; the implementation body may land in L7, but each named function now has a typed input/result body and either a pseudocode anchor or an explicit L7 defer. `explicit_l7_defer` means the L6 contract is frozen here and the L7 implementation must not invent new requirements.

Common value bodies:

```ts
type EvidencePath = string;
type Finding = { code: string; severity: "info" | "warn" | "error"; evidence_path: EvidencePath; message: string };
type ContractResult = { ok: boolean; findings: Finding[]; evidence_paths: EvidencePath[] };
type HarnessDbDeps = { repoRoot: string; dbPath: string; readText(path: string): string | null; now(): string };
type ProjectionRef = { table: string; id: string; evidence_path: EvidencePath };
type QualitySignal = { signal_type: string; subject_id: string; score?: number; evidence_path: EvidencePath };
```

| `scoreTaskComplexity` | `ScoreTaskComplexityInput { size; dependencies; uncertainty; affected_artifacts } -> ScoreTaskComplexityResult { score; class; findings[] }` | implemented in `src/workflow/contracts.ts`; unknowns produce uncertainty, not low complexity |
| `resolveDriveStatePartition` | `ResolveDriveStatePartitionInput { drive; mode; kind; layer; plan_id?; session_id? } -> ResolveDriveStatePartitionResult { partition_path; skip_sub_doc[] }` | implemented in `src/workflow/contracts.ts`; drive state joins by plan/session and never contaminates other drives |
| `classifyDrive` | `ClassifyDriveInput { plan; code_delta?; dependency_delta? } -> ClassifyDriveResult { drive; confidence; findings[] }` | implemented in `src/workflow/contracts.ts`; low confidence requires finding/human confirmation |
| `buildAdapterPlan` | `BuildAdapterPlanInput { provider; role; task; plan; execution_mode } -> BuildAdapterPlanResult extends ContractResult { command_plan; boundary_flags[] }` | implemented in `src/runtime/adapter.ts`; provider boundary flags are preserved |
| `catalogSkills` | `CatalogSkillsInput { skill_docs: SkillDocRef[] } -> CatalogSkillsResult extends ContractResult { skills: SkillCatalogEntry[] }` | implemented in `src/workflow/contracts.ts`; metadata only, source docs remain SSoT |
| `recommendSkills` | `RecommendSkillsInput { task; layer; drive; catalog } -> RecommendSkillsResult { recommendations[]; findings[] }` | implemented in `src/workflow/contracts.ts`; missing metadata is a finding |
| `buildCommandCatalog` | `BuildCommandCatalogInput { command_docs[]; cli_surface } -> BuildCommandCatalogResult extends ContractResult { commands[] }` | implemented in `src/workflow/contracts.ts`; search rows are rebuildable projection |

## 2026-06-09 L6 Completion Readiness Addendum

`analyzeL6Completion` is the G6 readiness aggregator. It separates `freezeInputReady` (trace/substance is ready for a G6 audit before status flip) from final `ready` (L6 completion after confirmed docs/plans, confirmed L7, and G6 PASS). It reads L6 design doc status, each L6 doc owning `plan:` reference, each L6 doc `pair_artifact`, L7 reverse references by L6 doc filename, minimum unit-contract substance markers (contract/signature, DbC or oracle, and U-* oracle family), base L6 `kind=design` PLAN status and review evidence, L7 unit-test-design status, and the G6 gate table row. Post-G6 `kind=add-design` PLANs are governed by add-feature/backfill/review evidence and do not reopen base G6 completion. The unit oracle is U-L6COMP-001..005 in `L7-unit-test-design.md`.

# UT-TDD Agent Harness — L6 機能設計: 関数仕様 (Function-Spec)

module-decomposition の公開 IF に**関数 signature・pseudocode・型・WBS** を付与する (PLAN-L6-01)。**G6 = 機能設計凍結点** (gate-design §1) の凍結対象を本 doc が確定し、L7 実装の正本 (parent_design) となる。

## §1 関数 signature 表 (実装済 module、module-decomposition §2 と 1:1)

> 詳細型は `src/schema/` を正本とし参照。pre/post は internal-processing §3/§4 への参照。

### §1.1 lint (共通様式 `loadX` / `analyzeX(docs?)`)

| 関数 (実 export、src/lint/) | signature | pre (§3) | post (§4) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `analyzeG3Trace` | `(docs?: DocSource) => G3TraceResult` | docs 省略時 fs 読込可 | `orphans[] == [] ⟺ ok`、totals 全 > 0 |
| `analyzeEntityCoverage` | `(business?: string) => EntityCoverageResult` | 同上 | primary⊇derived 整合、totals > 0 |
| `analyzeFrRegistry` | `(docs?: FrDocSource) => FrRegistryAuditResult` | 同上 | 漏れ 5 型 == 0 で ok |
| `analyzeDocConsistency` | `(docs?: DocConsistencySource) => DocConsistencyResult` | 同上 | carry/screenId/nfr 違反 == 0 で ok |
| `analyzeImprovementBacklog` | `(md?: string) => ImprovementBacklogResult` | 同上 | IMP 形式/status/候補 enum 妥当で ok |
| `loadDocs` / `loadBusiness` / `loadFrDocs` / `loadDocConsistencyDocs` / `loadBacklog` | 各 `() => DocSource \| string \| FrDocSource \| DocConsistencySource \| string` (lint 別、統一型なし) | repo doc path 解決可 | 副作用 = fs read のみ (write なし) |

> 共通 invariant: `analyzeX` は純粋関数 (同入力→同出力、FR-05 決定論)。`loadX` が唯一の fs 端点 (module-decomposition §4)。**引数/戻り型は lint ごとに固有** (統一 `XSource` 型は存在しない。実 export 名・型は `src/lint/*.ts` を正本)。

### §1.2 runtime

| 関数 (実 export、src/runtime/) | signature | pre | post |
|---|---|---|---|
| `detectMode` | `() => RuntimeDetection` | (前提なし) | `mode ∈ {standalone,claude-only,codex-only,hybrid}`、副作用なし |
| `normalizeModelFamily` | `(raw: string \| null \| undefined) => ModelFamily \| null` | — | family ∈ {opus,sonnet,haiku} or `null` (判定不能・曖昧は fail-close) |
| `evaluateAgentGuard` | `(input: AgentGuardInput, ctx: AgentGuardContext) => GuardDecision` | input.subagent_type 存在 / ctx に `resolveAgentFamily` + `allowRaw` 提供 | `decision.code ∈ {0,2}` を**返す**。`code=2` の exit 実行は hook shim (`.claude/hooks/agent-guard.ts`) の責務 — 本関数は純粋 (process.exit しない)。bypass は `bypassed=true` + message warn |
| `resolveActivePlan` / `recordEvent` / `compressPlanDigest` / `onStop` (session-log) | `session-log.md §3` 参照 | — | **fail-OPEN** (常に 0、guard と逆)。`compressPlanDigest` は純関数・idempotent。詳細は `session-log.md` (PLAN-L6-03 add-design 差分) |

### §1.3 schema / plan / vmodel / doctor

| 関数 | signature | pre | post |
|---|---|---|---|
| `frontmatterSchema.parse` | `(data: unknown) => Frontmatter` | — | zod 妥当 or throw ZodError |
| `lintPlan` | `(path?: string, gate?: "schedule" \| "governance" \| "frontmatter" \| "G1-trace" \| "G3-trace") => LintResult` | path 省略時カレント | `{ok, messages[]}`、state 不変 (read-only)。schedule は最小強制、governance/frontmatter は PLAN frontmatter + cross-record strict、G1/G3 は trace gate |
| `lintVmodel` | `(path?: string) => LintResult` | 同上 | 12 edge 照合、孤児で ok=false |
| `runDoctor` | `() => LintResult` | detector/lint の読む doc 解決可 | 全 detector 集約、error≥1 で ok=false/exit 1 |

## §2 core 操作の pseudocode (IEEE 1016 §5.7、IMP-019)

> internal-processing §2 の処理フローをアルゴリズム化。L7 実装の正本。共通骨格 = `入力 → zod validate → state 読込 → 処理 → state 書込 → 出力/exit` (副作用は cli/hook 端点)。

### §2.1 `plan draft` (FR-01)

```
function planDraft(input):
  assert input.title != ""                       # pre (§3)
  assert input.kind in VALID_KINDS
  assert input.layer in VALID_LAYERS
  if input.kind == "design" and input.layer in L1..L6:
    assert input.subDoc is provided              # G.1
  fm = buildFrontmatter(input)
  validated = frontmatterSchema.parse(fm)        # throw → fail-close
  if registry.has(validated.plan_id):
    error("plan_id 重複", FR-01); exit 1
  path = resolvePlanPath(validated)              # §1.10 line 418 規約
  # 原子性 = tmp file + rename (失敗時 file 不変)
  tmpPath = path + ".tmp"
  write(tmpPath, render(validated))
  rename(tmpPath, path)                          # post: 原子的 publish
  registry.add(validated.plan_id, path)
  exit 0
```

### §2.2 `gate <G-ID>` (FR-05、決定論 = AI 呼ばない)

```
function runGate(gId):
  assert gId in G0.5..G14                         # pre
  assert phase.priorGatesPassed(gId)              # V-model 順序 (FR-13)
  checks = loadGateChecks(gId)                    # gate-checks.yaml
  results = []
  for check in checks:                            # 決定論実行のみ
    results.append(check.run())                   # 純粋判定 (no AI)
  status = all(results.ok) ? "passed" : "failed"
  phase.gates[gId].status = status               # post: 証跡
  appendGateRun(gId, results)
  exit status == "passed" ? 0 : 1
```

### §2.3 `trace check` (FR-03)

```
function traceCheck(planId):
  plan = registry.get(planId)                     # pre: 存在
  assert plan.generates is not empty
  artifacts = resolve4Artifacts(plan)             # 設計/実装/テスト設計/テスト
  edges = checkBidir12(artifacts)                 # 双方向 12 edge
  orphans = edges.filter(e => not e.resolved)
  report(edges, orphans)
  exit orphans == [] ? 0 : 1                       # post: fail-close
```

### §2.4 `sprint check` (FR-02、TDD Red-first)

```
function sprintCheck(target):
  assert L6.functionDesignFrozen()                # pre: G6 通過
  redCommit = findRedTestCommit(target)
  greenCommit = findBodyCommit(target)
  assert redCommit.precedes(greenCommit)          # Red-first 順序
  recordTddTrace(redCommit, greenCommit)          # post
  exit ordered ? 0 : 1
```

## §3 型 / 値オブジェクト設計 (class-design 縮退統合)

> UT-TDD は非 OOP。型は zod schema (`src/schema/`) を単一正本とし、本節は L6 で確定する**追加型**のみ。

| 型 | 種別 | 定義 (実 src を正本) | carry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SubDoc` | 値オブジェクト (plan governance lint) | §1.10.G.1 VALID_SUB_DOCS の層別 enum。現行 `analyzePlanGovernance` が L1-L6 design PLAN の sub_doc 欠落 / 層外値 / duplicate layer+sub_doc / skip_sub_doc reason を検出 | implemented |
| `PlanId` | 値オブジェクト (zod regex) | **現行** = `src/schema/frontmatter.ts` `PLAN-(L0..L14\|DISCOVERY\|REVERSE\|RECOVERY\|M)-NN-slug`。横断 token と kind の整合も `frontmatterSchema` で検証 | implemented |
| `RuleType` | 判別共用体 (discriminated union) | `{ id: "pair-exists" \| "ref-resolves" \| "trace-bidir" \| "upstream-coverage" \| "count-matches" \| "id-format" \| "dup-id" \| "glossary-delta" \| "dependency-drift" \| "backlog-format" }` (discriminant = `id`、§4) | IMP-033 (L6 本 doc §4) |
| `GuardDecision` | interface (実装済、`src/runtime/agent-guard.ts:55`) | `{ code: 0 \| 2, message?: string, bypassed?: boolean }` (exit code を返すのみ、block boolean は持たない) | 実装済 |
| `RuntimeDetection` | interface (実装済、`src/runtime/detect.ts:10`) | `{ mode: ExecutionMode, claude: boolean, codex: boolean, currentRuntime: "claude"\|"codex"\|null, availableRuntimes: string[], missingRuntimes: string[] }`。**検出契約 (A-128 F-7、2026-06-10)**: Windows の binary 探索 (`onPath`) は finder (`where.exe`) を PATH 探索せず `%SystemRoot%\System32` から canonical に解決する — PATH 注入事故 (System32 欠落) で finder 自体が不在となり全 runtime を unavailable と誤検出する事故を防ぐ (oracle = `tests/runtime-hook-entrypoints.test.ts` の wrapper lifecycle 群が壊れた PATH 下でも green) | 実装済 |
| `LintResult` | interface (実装済、`src/plan/lint.ts`) | `{ ok: boolean, messages: string[] }` | 実装済 |

> 値オブジェクト不変条件 = zod schema が parse 時に保証 (internal-processing §5 invariant「state は zod 妥当のみ永続化」の型レベル写像)。クラス階層は導入しない (依存方向 = schema 安定核、module-decomposition §4)。**実装済型は実 src 定義を正本とし、本表はその写し** (発明禁止)。

## §4 IMP-033: クロスチェックエンジン rule 型 (gate-design §5)

> 自動追加型クロスチェック (gate-design §4) の rule registry を構成する 10 型。各 rule = 純粋関数 (FR-05 決定論)。doc registry (frontmatter scan) が enroll、gate binding が G_N へ束ねる。

### §4.1 共通 signature

```
type Rule = (registry: DocRegistry, params: RuleParams) => RuleResult
type RuleResult = { ruleId, ok: boolean, violations: Violation[] }
```

### §4.2 10 rule 型 (signature + 1 行 pseudocode)

| # | rule 型 | signature 概要 | pseudocode 要旨 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pair-exists` | `(reg, {layer}) => RuleResult` | 設計 doc に対応する pair (テスト設計) doc が存在するか |
| 2 | `ref-resolves` | `(reg, {field}) => RuleResult` | frontmatter の path 参照 (requires/pair) が repo 内に実在 |
| 3 | `trace-bidir` | `(reg, {from,to}) => RuleResult` | A→B 参照に対し B→A 逆参照が存在 (孤児 0) |
| 4 | `upstream-coverage` | `(reg, {childLayer,parentLayer}) => RuleResult` | 下流 ID が上流 ID で全被覆 (FR↔BR 等) |
| 5 | `count-matches` | `(reg, {declared,actual}) => RuleResult` | §0 件数宣言 = 実カウント (ドリフト検出) |
| 6 | `id-format` | `(reg, {pattern}) => RuleResult` | ID が regex 規約に従う (PlanId/FR-ID 等) |
| 7 | `dup-id` | `(reg, {idKind}) => RuleResult` | ID 一意 (重複 0) |
| 8 | `glossary-delta` | `(reg) => RuleResult` | per-工程の用語更新が glossary に反映 (G.9) |
| 9 | `dependency-drift` | `(reg, {expectedMap}) => RuleResult` | 実 import グラフ = 期待依存マップ (ADR-002/IMP-032) |
| 10 | `backlog-format` | `(reg) => RuleResult` | IMP-NNN 形式 + status/候補 enum 妥当 |

> 既存 5 lint (g3-trace/entity-coverage/fr-registry-audit/doc-consistency/improvement-backlog) は上記の rule インスタンスとして吸収 (gate-design §5)。auto-enroll = doc registry が新 doc の frontmatter (layer/sub_doc/pair_artifact) を scan し該当 rule を自動適用 (手書き lint 不要)。

### §4.3 auto-enroll pseudocode

```
function buildCoverageMap():
  registry = scanFrontmatter(docs/**)            # doc registry
  for doc in registry:
    rules = matchRulesByMetadata(doc)            # layer/sub_doc → 適用 rule
    for rule in rules:
      coverage[doc][rule] = rule(registry, paramsFor(doc))
  bindToGates(coverage)                          # gate binding (G_N)
  return coverage                                # 構造軸 = engine、意味軸 = self-review
```

## §5 WBS (関数群 → L7 実装 Sprint、G6 WBS 要件)

| Sprint | 対象関数群 | 依存 | 状態 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L7.1** | schema 拡張 (`subDocSchema` IMP-026 / `planIdSchema` 層別 IMP-004) | — (安定核) | 実装済 (`src/schema/index.ts` / `src/schema/frontmatter.ts`) |
| **L7.2** | `lintPlan` 本実装 (schedule + governance/frontmatter + G1/G3 trace gate) | schema / trace lint | implemented; repo debt closed and doctor hard-gates `plan-schedule` / `plan-governance` |
| **L7.3** | `lintVmodel` 本実装 (12 edge trace) | schema | implemented |
| **L7.4** | `runDoctor` 統合 (5 lint + state 突合) | lint 群 | scaffold→本 |
| **L7.5** | rule engine 10 型 + auto-enroll (IMP-033) | schema/lint | 実装済 (`src/lint/*` hard gates + doctor integration) |
| **L7.6** | dependency-drift lint (built-in TS import graph、optional knip/madge は adapter insight、ADR-002/IMP-032) | runtime | 実装済 (`src/lint/dependency-drift.ts` / `tests/dependency-drift.test.ts`、PLAN-REVERSE-42) |
| **L7.7** | L7 closure module surface (workflow/session/cutover/review/skill/asset 等) | schema | 実装済 (`src/workflow/`、`src/handover/`、`src/runtime/`、`src/skills/`、`src/assets/`、CLI surface) |

> 各 Sprint = TDD Red-first (L7 entry、§1.10 line 671)。先行 ④ 単体テストコードは L7 単体テスト設計 (pair) の U-* に対応。

## §6 carry → edge-case (L6) / L7 実装

- 各関数の `@edge-*` docstring per-function 確定 = [edge-case.md](./edge-case.md) (IMP-014、internal-processing §7 枠を展開)
- signature の TS 実体化 + DbC docstring 転記 = L7 (parent_design = 本 doc)
- pseudocode (§2/§4.3) の実装 = L7 各 Sprint
- DbC → U-* test oracle 導出 = L7 単体テスト設計 (pair、document-system-map §3)
- **G6 freeze**: 本 doc の signature + pseudocode + 型 + WBS を G6 で凍結 (L7 の parent_design 正本)
## Appendix B: BR-21 evaluation trace coverage addendum

The BR-21 evaluation hooks are Phase B oriented, but the function-design trace must not skip L6 once L4/L5 module boundaries name them. This addendum records the L6 contract landing points for the current evaluation surfaces; detailed algorithm expansion remains in the owning Phase B PLAN.

| trace | L6 contract landing |
|---|---|
| FR-L1-36 | skill evaluation input is normalized as skill metric feedback before Learning Engine aggregation |
| FR-L1-38 | model evaluation input is normalized as model/effort quality feedback before recommendation updates |
| FR-L1-43 | PoC success measurement input is normalized as verification outcome feedback before recipe/risk aggregation |

## Appendix C: L7 clean checkout DB projection invariant

`harness-check` must run deterministic `db rebuild` before tests in a clean checkout. The projection layer must derive `hook_events` from tracked provider handover evidence when ignored local session logs are absent, and `ut-tdd skill suggest --json` must rebuild a read-only in-memory DB from source when persistent `.ut-tdd/harness.db` is absent.

## Appendix D: PLAN-L7-51 同梱 lint モジュール契約 back-fill (PLAN-L7-52 C-4, 2026-06-15)

PLAN-L7-51 が impl-ahead で着地した 4 モジュール (`plan-dod`, `placeholder-deps`, `l7-completion`, `drive-db-registration`) の L6 契約を後追いで明文化する。parent PLAN = PLAN-L7-51。oracle ID 宣言 (U-* / FR-L1-*) は L7 oracle slice で別途行うため本 addendum では省略し、関数 signature + DbC + doctor 配線のみを記録する。

### D.1 `src/lint/plan-dod.ts`

| 関数 (実 export) | signature | pre | post | doctor 配線 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `loadPlanDodDocs` | `(root?: string) => PlanDodDoc[]` | `root` 省略時は `process.cwd()`; `docs/plans/` が存在しない場合は空配列を返す | fs read のみ (write なし); 返り値は `PLAN-L7-*.md` ファイルを sort 順で列挙した `PlanDodDoc[]` | `checkPlanDod` 内部で呼ばれる |
| `analyzePlanDod` | `(docs: PlanDodDoc[]) => PlanDodResult` | `docs` は `loadPlanDodDocs` の返り値相当; 純粋関数 (fs アクセスなし) | `status` が `confirmed` または `completed` の PLAN の DoD セクション内に未チェック項目 (`- [ ]`) が 1 件でもあれば `ok=false`; 対象 PLAN が 0 件の場合は `checked=0` (警告扱い) | `checkPlanDod` が `planDodMessages` とともに `runDoctor` へ集約 |
| `planDodMessages` | `(result: PlanDodResult) => string[]` | `result` は `analyzePlanDod` の返り値 | `checked=0` のとき警告メッセージを 1 件返す; `ok=true` のとき合格メッセージを返す; 違反時は最大 8 件のサンプル (`planId:line`) を含む違反メッセージを返す | `checkPlanDod` → `runDoctor.messages` に `doctor:` プレフィックスで合流 |

型定義:

```ts
interface PlanDodDoc { path: string; planId: string; status: string; text: string }
interface PlanDodViolation { planId: string; path: string; line: number; item: string }
interface PlanDodResult { checked: number; violations: PlanDodViolation[]; ok: boolean }
```

共通 invariant: `analyzePlanDod` は純粋関数 (同入力→同出力)。`loadPlanDodDocs` が唯一の fs 端点。`status` フィルタは `confirmed` / `completed` のみ対象とし、それ以外の PLAN は DoD 検査をスキップする。

### D.2 `src/lint/placeholder-deps.ts`

| 関数 (実 export) | signature | pre | post | doctor 配線 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `loadPlaceholderDepsDocs` | `(root?: string) => PlaceholderDepsDoc[]` | `root` 省略時は `process.cwd()`; 対象ディレクトリが存在しない場合は空配列を返す | `docs/design/harness/` と `docs/test-design/harness/` を再帰 walk して `.md` ファイルを収集; path は repo root からの相対パスで正規化; sort 済みで返す | `checkPlaceholderDeps` 内部で呼ばれる |
| `analyzePlaceholderDeps` | `(docs: PlaceholderDepsDoc[]) => PlaceholderDepsResult` | `docs` は `loadPlaceholderDepsDocs` の返り値相当; 純粋関数 | active (`""` / `confirmed` / `completed`) の doc に L7 を待ち先とする未解決の依存宣言行が残る、または専用 doctor rule が未整備との自己申告行が残る場合は `ok=false` | `checkPlaceholderDeps` → `runDoctor` |
| `placeholderDepsMessages` | `(result: PlaceholderDepsResult) => string[]` | `result` は `analyzePlaceholderDeps` の返り値 | `ok=true` のとき合格メッセージ (`checked=N, active L7 waits=0`) を返す; 違反時は最大 8 件のサンプル (`path:line`) を含む違反メッセージを返す | `checkPlaceholderDeps` → `runDoctor.messages` |

型定義:

```ts
interface PlaceholderDepsDoc { path: string; status: string; text: string }
interface PlaceholderDepsViolation { path: string; line: number; detail: string }
interface PlaceholderDepsResult { checked: number; violations: PlaceholderDepsViolation[]; ok: boolean }
```

共通 invariant: active status の判定は lowercase で行う。`placeholder_deps` が残存するドキュメントは design/test-design ともに対象。`analyzePlaceholderDeps` は純粋関数 (fs アクセスなし)。

### D.3 `src/lint/l7-completion.ts`

| 関数 (実 export) | signature | pre | post | doctor 配線 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `loadL7CompletionDocs` | `(root?: string) => L7CompletionDoc[]` | `root` 省略時は `process.cwd()`; 対象ディレクトリが存在しない場合は空 | `docs/design/harness/L4-basic-design/`, `L5-detailed-design/`, `L6-function-design/` を再帰 walk; path は repo root からの相対パスで正規化; sort 済みで返す | `checkL7Completion` 内部で呼ばれる |
| `classifyStaleL7Line` | `(line: string) => string \| null` | 任意の文字列行; 純粋関数 | L7 完了後も残存する陳腐化記述 (要約行が残作業を carry と述べる / orchestration 本体を未着手と述べる / CI 配線を後続へ送ると述べる / WBS 行が未完ステータスを保持する など計 6 パターン) を検出し分類メッセージを返す; 該当なし = `null` | `analyzeL7Completion` の内部ヘルパー (外部公開のみ、doc 配線なし) |
| `analyzeL7Completion` | `(docs: L7CompletionDoc[]) => L7CompletionResult` | `docs` は `loadL7CompletionDocs` の返り値相当; 純粋関数 | active status の doc 各行に対して `classifyStaleL7Line` を適用; 1 件でも陳腐化パターンが残存すれば `ok=false`; 対象 doc が 0 件のとき `checked=0` (警告扱い) | `checkL7Completion` → `runDoctor` |
| `l7CompletionMessages` | `(result: L7CompletionResult) => string[]` | `result` は `analyzeL7Completion` の返り値 | `ok=true` のとき合格メッセージ (`checked=N, stale L7 blockers=0`) を返す; 違反時は最大 8 件のサンプル (`path:line`) を含む違反メッセージを返す | `checkL7Completion` → `runDoctor.messages` |

型定義:

```ts
interface L7CompletionDoc { path: string; status: string; text: string }
interface L7CompletionViolation { path: string; line: number; detail: string; sample: string }
interface L7CompletionResult { checked: number; violations: L7CompletionViolation[]; ok: boolean }
```

共通 invariant: 対象スコープは L4-L6 design doc のみ (L7 PLAN 自体は対象外)。`classifyStaleL7Line` は正規表現マッチで判定し false-positive を避けるため `active design doc 内の WBS 表・モジュール一覧・サマリ行` に限定したパターンを使う。`analyzeL7Completion` は純粋関数。

### D.4 `src/lint/drive-db-registration.ts`

| 関数 (実 export) | signature | pre | post | doctor 配線 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `analyzeDriveDbRegistration` | `(stats: DriveDbRegistrationStats \| null) => DriveDbRegistrationResult` | `stats` は `.ut-tdd/harness.db` から呼び出し元が事前に取得したもの; `null` = DB 不在 or 読み取り失敗; 純粋関数 | `null` のとき `violations=[{reason:"missing_db"}]`, `ok=false`; stats が供給された場合は plan 登録数・drive runs・workflow/model/skill runs・hook events・必須 mode 5 種 (`Discovery/Forward/Recovery/Reverse/Verification`) の各存在を検査し、1 件でも欠落があれば `ok=false` | `checkDriveDbRegistration` → `runDoctor` |
| `driveDbRegistrationMessages` | `(result: DriveDbRegistrationResult) => string[]` | `result` は `analyzeDriveDbRegistration` の返り値 | `ok=false` のとき最大 8 件の違反理由サンプル (`reason[:mode][=count]`) を含む違反メッセージを返す; `ok=true` のとき全 stats を含む合格メッセージを返す | `checkDriveDbRegistration` → `runDoctor.messages` |

型定義:

```ts

共通 invariant: `analyzeDriveDbRegistration` は純粋関数 (DB アクセスは呼び出し元の `checkDriveDbRegistration` が担う)。必須 mode リスト (`Discovery/Forward/Recovery/Reverse/Verification`) は実装内定数 `REQUIRED_CURRENT_MODES` を単一正本とし、本契約の一覧はその写し。orphan 検査は stats フィールドの正値チェックで行い、DB クエリを直接発行しない。

parent PLAN = PLAN-L7-50。L6 契約なし着地分の後追い明文化。oracle ID 宣言は L7 oracle slice で別途行うため本サブセクションでは省略し、関数 signature + DbC + doctor 配線のみを記録する。

| 関数 (実 export) | signature | pre | post | doctor 配線 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverage` | `(docs: FrRoadmapCoverageDoc[]) => FrRoadmapCoverageResult` | `docs` は `loadFrRoadmapCoverageDocs` 等で事前に取得したもの; fs アクセスなし (純粋); `repoRoot` は `process.cwd()` で補完 | `FrRoadmapCoverageResult` を返す; `checked=docs.length`; 各 doc の残留 bucket テーブル (`## Residual Feature Buckets`) が存在しない場合 `violations` に `missing_section` を積む; 既定 bucket 集合 (R1〜R9) のうち doc 内に未出現のものは `missing_expected_bucket` として違反; 解決が特定できない open 行は `ambiguous_resolution` 違反; `closed` 行には closure evidence セクション (`## Residual Feature Closure Evidence`) の対照検査を行い、plan/source/test 各参照先の fs 実在を `process.cwd()` 基準で検証; 全 violations = 0 かつ open rows = 0 のとき `ok=true` | `checkFrRoadmapCoverage` → `runDoctor.ok` / `runDoctor.messages` |
| `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverageWithRoot` | `(docs: FrRoadmapCoverageDoc[], repoRoot: string) => FrRoadmapCoverageResult` | `docs` は取得済み; `repoRoot` は fs 実在確認の基点パス; `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverage` の実装委譲先 (repoRoot を明示渡し) | 同上; closure evidence の plan/source/test 参照先は `join(repoRoot, path)` で存在検証; `missing_evidence_file` 違反はファイルが実在しない場合に積む; 純粋性の例外 = fs 実在確認 (`existsSync`) を内部で呼ぶ | `checkFrRoadmapCoverage` の内部委譲先 |
| `loadFrRoadmapCoverageDocs` | `(repoRoot?: string) => FrRoadmapCoverageDoc[]` | `repoRoot` 省略時は `process.cwd()` を使用; fs 端点; 対象ファイルが存在しない場合は空配列を返す (fail-open) | `.ut-tdd/audit/A-133-upstream-vmodel-coverage-audit.md` を読み込み `FrRoadmapCoverageDoc[]` として返す; `file` フィールドは `join(".ut-tdd", "audit", "A-133-upstream-vmodel-coverage-audit.md")` (repo 相対) | `checkFrRoadmapCoverage` の唯一の fs 端点 |
| `frRoadmapCoverageMessages` | `(result: FrRoadmapCoverageResult) => string[]` | `result` は `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverage` / `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverageWithRoot` の返り値; 純粋関数 | `checked=0` のとき bucket テーブル不在を示す単一違反メッセージを返す; violations > 0 のとき最大 8 件のサンプル (`file[:bucket]:reason`) を含む違反メッセージを返す; open rows > 0 のとき status 別カウントと bucket 一覧を含むメッセージを返す; すべて解決済みのとき `OK (checked=N, buckets=N, closure=N)` 形式の合格メッセージを返す | `checkFrRoadmapCoverage` → `runDoctor.messages` |

型定義:

```ts
type FrRoadmapCoverageStatus = "closed" | "scheduled" | "parked" | "PO decision";

interface FrRoadmapCoverageDoc {
  file: string;    // repo 相対パス
  content: string; // ファイル全文
}

interface FrRoadmapCoverageRow {
  file: string; bucket: string; upstreamSource: string;
  currentRoute: string; vmodelState: string;
  requiredNextArtifact: string; status: FrRoadmapCoverageStatus;
}

interface FrRoadmapClosureEvidenceRow {
  file: string; bucket: string; planTarget: string;
  sourceTarget: string; testTarget: string;
  coverageGate: string; status: FrRoadmapCoverageStatus;
}

interface FrRoadmapCoverageViolation {
  file: string; bucket?: string;
  reason:
    | "missing_section" | "missing_table" | "malformed_row"
    | "missing_expected_bucket" | "missing_upstream_source"
    | "missing_current_route" | "missing_vmodel_state"
    | "missing_next_artifact" | "unknown_status" | "ambiguous_resolution"
    | "missing_closure_section" | "missing_closure_table"
    | "malformed_closure_row" | "missing_closure_evidence"
    | "missing_plan_target" | "missing_source_target"
    | "missing_test_target" | "missing_coverage_gate"
    | "missing_evidence_file" | "closure_status_mismatch";
}

interface FrRoadmapCoverageResult {
  checked: number; rows: FrRoadmapCoverageRow[];
  closureRows: FrRoadmapClosureEvidenceRow[];
  openRows: FrRoadmapCoverageRow[];
  violations: FrRoadmapCoverageViolation[]; ok: boolean;
}
```

doctor 配線 (src/doctor/index.ts):

`checkFrRoadmapCoverage(repoRoot)` が `loadFrRoadmapCoverageDocs(repoRoot)` → `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverageWithRoot(docs, repoRoot)` → `frRoadmapCoverageMessages(result)` の順に委譲し、`{ messages, ok }` を返す。`runDoctor` は line 974 で `frRoadmapCoverage = checkFrRoadmapCoverage(deps.repoRoot)` を呼び、`frRoadmapCoverage.ok` を全体 `ok` の AND 条件 (line 1014)、`frRoadmapCoverage.messages` を `doctor:` プレフィックス付きで全メッセージに展開 (line 1057) する。

共通 invariant: `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverage` / `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverageWithRoot` は純粋関数 (fs アクセスは `analyzeFrRoadmapCoverageWithRoot` 内の `existsSync` による closure evidence 存在確認のみ; doc 読み込み端点は `loadFrRoadmapCoverageDocs` に集約)。bucket 検査の対象集合 (R1〜R9) は実装内定数 `EXPECTED_BUCKETS` を単一正本とし、本契約の列挙はその写し。`normalizeStatus` はバッククォート除去後に `VALID_STATUSES` と照合し、不一致は `unknown_status` 違反とする。open bucket の解決文言は `RESOLUTION_PATTERN` 正規表現で検証し、パターン不一致は `ambiguous_resolution` 違反とする。`closed` 行には closure evidence の対照が必須であり、evidence 行が欠落する場合は `missing_closure_evidence` 違反として `ok=false` となる。
