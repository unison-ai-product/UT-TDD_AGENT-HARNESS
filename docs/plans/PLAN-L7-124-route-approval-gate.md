# PLAN-L7-124: route approval gate

## Objective

Make `requires_human_approval=true` route outputs fail closed until a policy and
matching approvals are available.

## Scope

- Mark recovery, incident, and retrofit `config_drift` routes as requiring
  human approval.
- Resolve `.ut-tdd/config/approval-policy.yaml` when evaluating route commands.
- Exit 1 for missing policy or missing approvals.
- Append blocked approval decisions to `.ut-tdd/audit/route-approval.jsonl`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `forced_stop` / recovery routing returns `requires_human_approval=true`.
- Missing approval policy produces exit 1, not a runnable green route.
- A policy with all required approvers returns exit 0.
- Blocked CLI runs append a JSONL audit record.
